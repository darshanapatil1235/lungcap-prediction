# lungcap-prediction
This project aims to predict lung capacity based on various health and demographic factors using machine learning techniques. Accurate prediction of lung capacity can aid in diagnosing respiratory conditions and tailoring medical treatments.
Predictive Analytics: Employs machine learning models to predict lung capacity from features such as age, gender, height, weight, and smoking status.
Data Processing: Comprehensive data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering.
Model Evaluation: Uses various metrics to evaluate model performance, including mean absolute error, mean squared error, and R-squared.
Visualization: Provides visualizations for data exploration and model performance assessment.
User Interface: Simple interface for inputting patient data and displaying predictions.
